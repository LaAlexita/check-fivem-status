  ## check FiveM status

-You can set up a specific channel to receive updates about the status of FiveM. They just need to use the !set-channel <channel_ID> command and the bot will do the rest.

-This bot is so attentive that it will only mention everyone in the channel when there is an important change in Fivem's status.

-Over time I will add more functions but for the moment it is a fairly simple bot.
